# GameTesting
Trying to build a simple 2D game engine. As simple as those things can be at any rate.

The Repo will be updated infrequently with large updates opposed to small ones.

At the current time I'm not interested in any collaboration (I'm still in the "learning experience" phase) but that may change in a few months.
